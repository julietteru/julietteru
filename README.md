## About Me:

First things first, I'm not good at introductions haha but I do want to let people who find their way here a bit about me. I am an uruguayan based developer currently working as a full stack developer. I love learning new things and I'm pretty curious so I also enjoy experimenting with different techonologies from time to time. I hope to display that in this space.

  - Xamarin (just a tiny bit)
  
* Javascrpt/ Jquery and CSS
